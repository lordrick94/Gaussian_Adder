# Gaussian_Adder
This code can be used to add fake sources to a data cube

Run the Beam_adder.py on your to add beam information to the header if it is in a bintable extension (This is common in ALMA data cubes)

The code can add any number of fake sources in random positions in the cube

Still working on adding noise to the fake sources
